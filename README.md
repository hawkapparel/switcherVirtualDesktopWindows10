# switcherVirtualDesktopWindows10
This is a little script for switch Virtual Desktop like Linux distributions (shortcut "Control" + "Alt" + Left/Right) in Windows 10

To implement this functionality in Windows 10 I use AutoHotKey.

AutoHotkey is a great program for doing this exact type of thing. It is an very useful program for remapping keyboard keys, letting you set up hotkeys, and automating tasks. Here are the steps to set this up:

1. Just download the file shortcutLikeLinux.exe and execute.

2. If it performs as expected, copy the script into the startup folder* so that it will run every time your computer starts.

*To access the startup folder in Windows 10, open "Run" (either press Windows Key + R, or search for it in the start menu) and type either (without quotes): "shell:startup" (to run the script for just the current user) or "shell:common startup" (to run it for all users). Paste it in the folder that opens.

If you want see the code, just open shortcutLikeLinux.ahk in notepad.
